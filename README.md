# A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners
Description
The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Every year it is given to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the prize was Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way. Surely, right?

Well, let's find out! What characteristics do the prize winners have? Which country gets it most often? And has anybody gotten it twice? It's up to you to figure this out.

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nobelfoundation/nobel-laureates) used in this project is from The Nobel Foundation on Kaggle.
## Usage
Clone this repository and open the Jupyter notebook file (`*.ipynb`) in a Jupyter environment with Python kernel support. Make sure to install the required packages such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`. You can do this by running the following commands in a code cell within the notebook:
```python
!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```
Once the packages are installed, run the code cells in the notebook to generate the plots and analyses.

If you don't have a Jupyter environment set up, you can install Jupyter Notebook and the Python kernel using the following steps:

1. Install Jupyter Notebook by following the instructions on the [official Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

2. Ensure you have Python installed. If not, you can download and install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
